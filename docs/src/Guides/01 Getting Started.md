# Introduction

Hi! So you want to make a bot powered by snakes. This guide aims to get you started as fast as possible, for more advanced use-cases check out the other guides.

### Requirements

- [x] Python 3.10 or greater
- [x] Know how to use `pip`
- [x] [A bot account](02 Creating Your Bot.md)
- [ ] An aversion to snakes

## Installation


### Virtual-Environments

We strongly recommend that you make use of Virtual Environments when working on any project.
This means that each project will have its own libraries of any version and does not affect anything else on your system.
Don't worry, this isn't setting up a full-fledged virtual machine, just small python environment.

=== ":material-linux: Linux"
    ```shell
    cd "[your bots directory]"
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

=== ":material-microsoft-windows: Windows"
    ```shell
    cd "[your bots directory]"
    py -3 -m venv venv
    venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

It's that simple, now you're using a virtual environment. If you want to leave the environment just type `deactivate`.
If you want to learn more about the virtual environments, check out [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

### Pip install

Now let's get the library installed.

=== ":material-linux: Linux"
    ```shell
    python3 -m pip install dis-snek --upgrade
    ```

=== ":material-microsoft-windows: Windows"
    ```shell
    py -3 -m pip install dis-snek --upgrade
    ```

## Basic bot

Now let's get a basic bot going, for your code, you'll want something like this:

```python
from dis_snek.client import Snake
from dis_snek.models.enums import Intents
from dis_snek.models.listener import listen

bot = Snake(intents=Intents.DEFAULT)
# intents are what events we want to receive from discord, `DEFAULT` is usually fine

@listen()  # this decorator tells snek that it needs to listen for the corresponding event, and run this coroutine
async def on_ready():
    # This event is called when the bot is ready to respond to commands
    print("Ready")
    print(f"This bot is owned by {bot.owner}")


@listen()
async def on_message_create(event):
    # This event is called when a message is sent in a channel the bot can see
    print(f"message received: {event.message.content}")


bot.start("Put your token here")
```

Congratulations! You now have a basic understanding of this library.
