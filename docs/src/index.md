!!! danger "Remember"
    Please note the naff package is now deprecated. Please migrate to [interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py), where future development will continue. 
    Interactions.py V5 is a combined release between interactions.py and naff. Migration is easy, and should only take an hour at most.


We hope this documentation is helpful for you, but don't just ++ctrl+c++ and ++ctrl+v++.

### `"What is this?"`
This is `NAFF`, an API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. This wrapper is designed to be easy to use, and easily modified to suit your needs.

#### Features:
- [x] 100% coverage of the application commands API
- [x] Modern and Pythonic API
- [x] Asynchronous operation
- [x] Proper rate limit handling
- [x] Dynamic cache with TTL support

___
### `"Is this just another discord.py fork?"`
While this library shares some features and stylistic choice with `discord.py`, its completely separate from them. We think `discord.py` is a fantastic library, but we disagree with the direction and design decisions made by it.

Compared to `discord.py`; `NAFF` starts faster, responds faster, and is simpler to use. Especially compared to `Views`.
