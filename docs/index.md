### `"What is this?"`
This is `Dis-Snek`, an API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. This wrapper is designed to be easy to use, and easily modified to suit your needs. 

### `"Is this just another discord.py fork"`?
While this library shares some features or styles with `discord.py`, its completely separate from them. We think `discord.py` is a fantastic library, but we disagree with the direction and design decisions made by it.

### `"I don't like how you've done x feature"`
Make an issue on our [:fontawesome-brands-github:GitHub](https://github.com/Discord-Snake-Pit/Dis-Snek) repo, and we can have a discussion on it. Or if you want faster responses, join our [:fontawesome-brands-discord:Discord](https://discord.gg/WCtUY2CRVu)
